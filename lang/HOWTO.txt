How to Translate the cats-jobsite Plugin with WordPress

If you are interested in translating the cats-jobsite (or any WP plugin) into a 
language other than English, this file will explain how to do so. WordPress 
uses the GetText libraries to provide translations. Although it is easy to 
find WordPress translations in many languages, those files do not out-of-the-box 
support the cats-jobsite plugin. An additional translation file must be built 
(if not already) with our language strings translated with GetText to accomplish 
this.

The first file you will need is our POT file, which includes all of our language 
strings. The latest copy is found in the "lang/" sub-directory of the cats-jobsite
plugin. To load the POT file and create translation files, you will need some 
software. Some popular software can be found in the "Translating WordPress" 
section of the following web site:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress

Follow the instructions that came with your software (LaunchPad, Pootle, poEdit,
KBabel, GNU Gettext, etc.) to load the POT file and create a .mo file.
YOU MUST HAVE A .mo FILE, NOT A .po FILE FOR TRANSLATIONS!
A .mo is just a compiled .po file, so if you have the .po file, again use one 
of the software tools above to compile it into a .mo file.

After writing the translations, we ask (but do not require) that you submit 
your .mo file back to the community so that others looking for the same language 
may benefit. The easiest way to do this is to email your .mo file to 
andrew@catsone.com or post it on our Developer's Corner Forum at 
http://www.catsone.com/.

Before writing translations, check if your language is already supported. A list 
of the currently available translation files can be found in the "lang/" 
sub-directory of the cats-jobsite plugin. All files ending in .mo are applicable 
language translation files.

IMPORTANT - NAMING SCHEME

All .mo files must meet certain naming criteria in order to be loaded. Our 
domain is 'cats-jobsite' (minus the single quotes). In addition to the domain, 
you will need your language code, which looks like 'en_US' or 'de'. For a list 
of some languages with codes, look at:

http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language

The naming criteria with the 'en_US' language code would be:

cats-jobsite-en_US.mo

You must follow this same format in order to translate the cats-jobsite plugin!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

It is presumed that you now have found a translation file (ending in .mo) and 
have named it in accordance with the naming scheme guidelines found in the 
previous section.

1) Copy the desired .mo file to the WordPress wp-content/plugins folder. 
   DO NOT LEAVE THE FILE IN THE 'lang/' SUB-DIRECTORY OR IN THE cats-jobsite 
   PLUGIN DIRECTORY! IT WILL ONLY WORK IN THE 'wp-content/plugins' DIRECTORY!

2) Edit your wp-config.php file (found in the root WordPress directory) and 
   look for the line similar to:
   
   define('WPLANG', '');
   
   Change it to include your language code, for 'en_US', use:

   define('WPLANG', 'en_US');

3) You're set! Reload your WordPress site and browse to the cats-jobsite 
   plugin and it should be in your native language.
